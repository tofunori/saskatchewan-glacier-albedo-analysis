# Statistical Validation Priority

## Current Assessment (2024-12-20)

### âœ… Excellent Foundation Already in Place
The Saskatchewan Glacier Albedo Analysis project already has **outstanding scientific rigor**:

1. **Mann-Kendall Trend Tests** - Proper non-parametric trend detection
   - Implements both pymannkendall library and manual fallback
   - Includes tau statistic, z-score, and proper p-values
   - Handles ties and missing data appropriately

2. **Sen's Slope Estimation** - Robust slope calculation
   - Uses scipy.stats.theilslopes for confidence intervals
   - Converts to meaningful units (per decade)
   - Provides 95% confidence intervals

3. **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals** - Advanced uncertainty quantification
   - Configurable number of iterations
   - Tracks proportion of significant tests
   - Comprehensive error handling

4. **Quality Controls** - Proper data validation
   - Autocorrelation checking (lag-1)
   - Missing data handling
   - Minimum observation thresholds

### ðŸŽ¯ Scientific Validation Next Steps

**Priority 1: Validation Testing**
- Run the existing trend analysis on current Saskatchewan Glacier data
- Compare results with published glacier albedo studies
- Verify statistical assumptions are met

**Priority 2: Method Enhancement**
- Add seasonal Mann-Kendall for seasonal data
- Implement trend-free pre-whitening for autocorrelated data
- Add change point detection algorithms

**Priority 3: Result Validation**
- Cross-validate with other glaciological datasets
- Compare trends with climate variables (temperature, precipitation)
- Validate against published Saskatchewan Glacier studies

### ðŸ“Š Current Statistical Methods Status
- âœ… Mann-Kendall: Industry standard, properly implemented
- âœ… Sen's Slope: Robust estimator with confidence intervals  
- âœ… Bootstrap: Advanced uncertainty quantification
- âœ… Quality Filtering: Appropriate for MODIS data
- âœ… Autocorrelation: Lag-1 assessment included

**Conclusion**: The statistical foundation is already scientifically sound. Focus should be on validation testing and result interpretation rather than method development.
